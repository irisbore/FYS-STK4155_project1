1. Should our code run just as well independent of the data set? We experience that by reducing the amount of data points in x and y, the results are better. 
2. Should our r2 values be between 0 and 1? If so, how should it be scaled? 
4. Why is the plots in a, b and c so dependent on the dataset?
5. Scaling in CV
6. fordeler med å skalere bare med std vs med mean?

7. Should we use the same seed for every plot generation? bootstrap only gives interpretable results for new seed. Ønsker egt samme hyperparametere i hver deloppgave
