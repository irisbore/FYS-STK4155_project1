In conclusion, this study provides a comparison of three linear regression techniques: OLS, Ridge, and Lasso, applied to both synthetic and real-world high-dimensional terrain data. The results demonstrate that Ridge regression consistently performs best across various polynomial degrees and regularization parameters on synthetic data from the uniform distribution. When switching to terrain data, Lasso performs best across the different conditions, although it was limited by the computational resources. OLS, while simpler, performed similar to the others when restricting the models to less features, highlighting that model complexity does not always guarantee better performance. The study underscores the importance of careful hyperparameter tuning and model selection, which should be based on the nature of the data and computational resources. Future work should focus on refining these models by leveraging more computational power and exploring higher degrees of model complexity, especially for real-world data applications.
